# C++ Workshop - Assignment Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of homework assignments from the C++ Workshop course (150018), covering fundamental to advanced C++ programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The assignments are organized by topic, progressing from basic object-oriented programming to more advanced concepts:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming Basics**
   - Rational numbers implementation
   - Employee data management
   - Circle representation and operations

2. **Classes with Dynamic Memory**
   - Points and polygons implementation
   - Vector class with dynamic memory allocation

3. **Operator Overloading and Strings**
   - Enhanced Rational class with operators
   - Date class with comparison operators
   - Custom String class implementation

4. **Advanced Class Features**
   - Clock class with exception handling
   - Account class (Bank ATM simulation)
   - Friend functions and static methods

5. **Data Structures**
   - Linked Lists implementation
   - Circular Linked Lists
   - Stack and Queue implementations
   - Binary Trees

6. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Employee hierarchy (Full-time/Part-time)
   - Shape hierarchy with polymorphic methods

7. **Templates and STL**
   - Template implementations for containers
   - Using STL containers and algorithms

8. **File Operations**
   - Binary file operations
   - Random access to files

## Assignment Details

Each assignment folder contains:
- The original assignment PDF
- Source code solutions
- Header files
- Implementation files
- Sample inputs and expected outputs when available

## Key Concepts Covered

This repository demonstrates proficiency in the following C++ concepts:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Memory management (constructors, destructors, copy/move semantics)
- Operator overloading
- Templates
- Exception handling
- STL containers and algorithms
- File I/O operations
- Data structures implementation

## Requirements

To compile and run these assignments, you'll need:

- C++ compiler with C++11 support or later (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming

## Usage

Each assignment can be compiled individually using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 assignment_file.cpp -o executable_name
./executable_name
```
